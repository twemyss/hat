# Home Acuity Assessment Aid (HAT) 

Generate and serve PDFs containing random combinations of optotypes, for home monitoring of visual acuity.

_Please note that these are **not** validated tests of vision, but are assessment aids for use in clinical research._

## About

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twemyss/hat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twemyss/hat) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/twemyss/hat/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/twemyss/hat)

This code is a port (to Rust) of the code powering [homeacuitytest.org](https://homeacuitytest.org), which is a _research tool_ (not yet a validated test of vision) for at-home monitoring of patient visual acuity. The aim of this tool is to reduce digital exclusion of people without access to smartphones or computers, through producing a printable test which can be easily administered over the telephone.

This codebase generates and serves PDFs containing random arrangements of optotypes.
