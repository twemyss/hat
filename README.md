# Home Acuity Test (HAT) 

Generate and serve PDFs containing random combinations of optotypes, for home monitoring of visual acuity.

## About

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twemyss/hat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twemyss/hat) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/twemyss/hat/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/twemyss/hat?branch=master)

This code is a port (to Rust) of the code powering [https://homeacuitytest.org/](homeacuitytest.org), which is a _research tool_ (not yet a validated test of vision) for at-home monitoring of patient visual acuity. The aim of this tool is to reduce digital exclusion of people without access to smartphones or computers, through producing a printable test which can be easily administered over the telephone.

This codebase generates and serves PDFs containing random arrangements of optotypes.
